Flutter WorkManager is a wrapper around [Android's WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager), [iOS' performFetchWithCompletionHandler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623125-application) and [iOS BGAppRefreshTask](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgapprefreshtask), effectively enabling headless execution of Dart code in the background.

<Info>
For iOS users, please watch this video on a general introduction to background processing: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/707. All of the constraints discussed in the video also apply to this plugin.
</Info>

This is especially useful to run periodic tasks, such as fetching remote data on a regular basis.

<Note>
This plugin was featured in this [Medium blogpost](https://medium.com/vrt-digital-studio/flutter-workmanager-81e0cfbd6f6e)

## Federated Plugin Architecture

This plugin uses a federated architecture, which means that the main `workmanager` package provides the API, while platform-specific implementations are in separate packages:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="workmanager" icon="dart-lang">
    The main package that provides the unified API
  </Card>
  <Card title="workmanager_platform_interface" icon="code">
    The common platform interface
  </Card>
  <Card title="workmanager_android" icon="android">
    Android-specific implementation
  </Card>
  <Card title="workmanager_apple" icon="apple">
    Apple platform (iOS/macOS) implementation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This architecture allows for better platform-specific optimizations and easier maintenance. When you add `workmanager` to your `pubspec.yaml`, the platform-specific packages are automatically included through the endorsed federated plugin system.
