## Architecture

This plugin uses a **federated architecture**:
- `workmanager` - Main package that provides the unified API
- `workmanager_android` - Android implementation using WorkManager
- `workmanager_apple` - iOS/macOS implementation using BGTaskScheduler
- `workmanager_platform_interface` - Shared interface for platform implementations

All packages are automatically included when you add `workmanager` to pubspec.yaml.
