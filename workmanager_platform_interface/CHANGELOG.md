## Future

### Dependencies & Infrastructure Updates
* Updated Pigeon from 22.7.4 to 26.0.0 for enhanced multi-platform support
* Regenerated platform interface files with new Pigeon version
* Fixed Kotlin null safety issues compatibility

### Breaking Changes
* **BREAKING**: Separate `ExistingWorkPolicy` and `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy` enums for better type safety
  * Mirrors Android's native WorkManager API design
  * `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy` now used for periodic tasks with three options: `keep`, `replace`, `update`
  * Added comprehensive documentation with upstream Android documentation links

## 0.8.0

  * `OutOfQuotaPolicy` values: `run_as_non_expedited_work_request` → `runAsNonExpeditedWorkRequest`, `drop_work_request` → `dropWorkRequest`
* **BREAKING**: Removed JSON serialization for inputData - now uses native Map transfer

### Features
* Add comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
* Support for all constraint types: network, battery, charging, device idle, storage
