# Update build.gradle

Make sure that your `kotlin_version to `1.4.0` or greater:

```
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.4.+'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    // ...
```

# Check your AndroidManifest.xml   

Check if you have the following in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.  

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="flutterEmbedding"
    android:value="2" />
```

Ideally you should have this, if not follow the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Upgrading-pre-1.12-Android-projects).  
If for some reason you can't upgrade yet we still support the [older way of embedding](ANDROID_SETUP_V1.md):

# How to Debug my background job

Debugging a background task can be difficult, Android decides when is the best time to run.  
There is no guaranteed way to enforce a run of a job even in debug mode.  

However to facilitate debugging, the plugin provides an `isInDebugMode` flag when initializing the plugin: `Workmanager().initialize(callbackDispatcher, isInDebugMode: true)`  

Once this flag is enabled you will receive a notification whenever a background task was triggered.  
This way you can keep track whether that task ran successfully or not.
